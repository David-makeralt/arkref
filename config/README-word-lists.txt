The lists of word classes in this directory were extracted from WordNet 3.0 by finding all hyponyms of high level terms.
The hyponym paths were followed all the way to the leaves of the WN "tree".
Each sense in WN has a count associated with it, which I believe comes from SemCore.
Only the most frequent senses for nouns were considered.  
Rare senses without any counts were only considered only if they had a single sense for a word (e.g., "cannibal").

The top level words from which the hyponyms were extracted are as follows:

location: location, geological formation, structure, facility
persons: person (plus the following single words: women, men, children, people)
organization: social group
time: point in time, time period, time unit (plus the following single words: today, tomorrow, yesterday, now, then, tonight, later, soon)
group:group
