* Too-long sentences for parser: back off to punctuation splits?

* cross-tree alignments (notes/crossing_nps.txt)

* in Precision report: "gold null" ... bug??

-implement for testing purposes: "then for each evaluation mention, 
we find the largest-span NP which has the previously determined mention
head as its head.5 Often, this results in a different, typically larger,
mention span than annotated in the data... If there is no NP headed by 
a given mention head, we add an NP over just that word." 


-path extraction and bootstrapping: "We take a simple bootstrapping technique: given a
set of mention pairs extracted from appositives
and predicate-nominative configurations, we extract
counts over tree fragments between nodes
which have occurred in this set of head pairs (see
Figure 5); the tree fragments are formed by annotating
the internal nodes in the tree path with
the head word and POS along with the subcategorization.
We limit the paths extracted in this way
in several ways: paths are only allowed to go between
adjacent sentences and have a length of at
most 10. We then filter the set of paths to those
which occur more than a hundred times and with
at least 10 distinct seed head word pairs."

-need not-totally-maximal head projections for gathing role-appos pairs
(pairing child and parent is wrong, want to pair siblings)
.. wait, this might be effectively equivalent, so wouldn't matter

- conjunctions of NPs: need to let each NP be a mention. "He and Fred went to
  the store / He bought ice cream" currently fails because "He and Fred" is one
  big mention.
