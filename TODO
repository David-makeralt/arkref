-sentbreaking and precleaning: ascii-normalization of curly quotes 
  (and whatever else to make the stanford tokenizer happy)
  
-implement for testing purposes: "then for each evaluation mention, 
we find the largest-span NP which has the previously determined mention
head as its head.5 Often, this results in a different, typically larger,
mention span than annotated in the data... If there is no NP headed by 
a given mention head, we add an NP over just that word."
